# Lesson 06: Project proposal

## Overview

This module begins the period of working exclusively on your final project. You will create a proposal for your final project which includes a project title, a description of the project, a list of features that the final project will include, and – most importantly – examples of usable data. This also starts the "alpha" version of a project, which identifies the desired features, perhaps inspired by previous mock-up designs, that you plan to implement. This is realized in your first digital mockup.

## Part I: Discussion on Canvas (2.5 pt)

Find the discussion forum called *What inspires you?* in our module on Canvas. Share a statement about what motivates you and guides your design choices. This is an open-ended response but try to identify your sources for inspiration. Finally, share a little bit about your final project idea.

## Part II: Project proposal (10 pts @ 2.5 pts each)

It's time to start thinking carefully about your final map project. The deliverable for this section will include five responsibilities:

1. Your data source and (at least a sample of) the data required to meet the map's objectives.
2. The map topic and geographic phenomena your map will explore.
3. An articulation of the map's objectives and user needs.
4. A summary of the predicted technology stack.
5. The first digital version of your mockup.


### 1. Data source

This one is crucial. Sometimes we have high goals and ideas for a map. But if we can't easily and quickly get the data in a fast-paced class like this, we don't leave much time for the design and development phases. Demonstrate access to your data, or very minimally some ugly data that we can consider strategies for refining and cleaning up (though we recommend you begin the data wrangling immediately).

**Provide:** 
1. Your anticipated data source and 
2. a small sample of the data (e.g., CSV/GeoJSON/Shapefile or a URL link to an accessible database). 
We need to be able to look at the data to give you quality feedback concerning your overall map objectives and what we can achieve in the next few weeks.

Still shopping for a topic? Sometimes just taking a stroll through data sources and visualizations can spark a great idea. Here are a few sources to get you started:

* https://www.data.gov/
* https://kygeonet.ky.gov/
* https://usa.ipums.org/usa/
* https://hub.arcgis.com/pages/open-data
* https://graphics.reuters.com/
* https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot
* https://pudding.cool/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/
* https://flowingdata.com/
* https://www.davidrumsey.com/

If you find a data source that you'd like to share, please do so in this module's discussion forum.

Don't have data after shopping around for a bit? Reach out for help ASAP! Check the modules' addenda for the different APIs for getting data. Most importantly, think about data and a map that you'll have fun making and that you'll be eager to share with those who are important to you.

### 2. Topic and geographic phenomena your map will explore

What are you mapping? Briefly describe the topic and the geography the map intends to represent. Also, provide a tentative title (and possibly a subtitle) for your project. Remember that good titles, while being provocative and potentially fun, can quickly summarize the mapping project.

**Provide:**

1. *What?*
2. *Where?*
3. *When?*
4. What is the tentative title of your project?

Then, think about how this will be realized in the browser:

5. Identify your anticipated methods of thematic representation methods (e.g., icons, choropleth, prop symbols, etc.).
6. Briefly describe your anticipated user interface (UI).


### 3. Map objectives and user needs

Answer these questions:

* Why does the map need to be made? Consider your position to the mapping project. Why are you the one to be designing it?
* What type of user do you expect to use this map and what needs do you anticipate they will have? 

### 4. Anticipating your technology stack

Your description of the technology stack should include:

* A description of the data and information processing tools used, e.g., QGIS, [MapShaper](http://www.mapshaper.org/), ArcGIS Pro, etc.
* The format you'll use to store your data, e.g., flat files such as CSV, GeoJSON, or dynamically from an API.
* The JS libraries you anticipate using or need like Leaflet, omnivore, Papa Parse, etc.

### 5. First digital version of your mockup

Create an *index.html* file to include a mockup of your map. This draft may not be contain the desired functionality. That's okay – and expected. Using your previous mockups as a guide, create the first digital realization of your map.

You can draw from existing class projects and templates to help develop this mockup. This web page should include the following:

1. A map with a basemap focused on your area of interest.
2. Use of the colors, icons, and other thematic elements you anticipate using and identified in previous responses.
3. A title and subtitle.
4. Placeholder for text and UI elements.
5. Code comments where you anticipate adding functionality.
6. Ideally, some visual representation of the data you are using.

### Project README.md

Consider these responses as a draft of the information you'll want to include in your final project repo's *README.md*. While informative to curious users of your map, the proposal also looks good to employers and clients in terms of demonstrating your expertise in the world of open source web mapping!
